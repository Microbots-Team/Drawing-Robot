## 📅 Project Timeline & Context

- **Event:** FMEE 2025 – **AI & Robotics Club** Open Day
- **Date:** November 10–11–12, 2025

## 💡 Project Overview

The **Drawing Robot** transforms digital images into **real drawings** on a flat surface using a **polar coordinate system**.  
Two stepper motors move the stylus with high precision, enabling the automated creation of various shapes, patterns, and artistic images.

The robot uses **digital image input** to generate precise drawing commands.  
Through its **polar coordinate system**, the robot translates the commands into **controlled movements of the stylus**, producing accurate and automated artwork on a canvas or paper.  

The project demonstrates the intersection of **technology and creativity**, making robotics accessible for artistic applications.
